			<p>
				Media is comprised of various forms of outlets that convey information. The internet, radio, social media, television, digital journalism, as well as print media like newspapers, books, and magazines are some common types of mass media. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We use these everyday for our entertainment and to learn more about our world, but do we ever stop to think about its credibility. How much of the information that we digest on a daily basis is actually reliable, and how do we distinguish fake news from the truth?
			</p>
			<p class="last-para">
				Being media literate allows us to access and evaluate the data that we come across, as well as create original and accurate content. We can better understand the creator’s message, and assess their trustworthiness and possible biases. Media literacy has two sub-categories: Digital literacy which focuses on digital media, and print literacy, which applies to print media.

				<li class="importance-list"><span class="accent">Helps develop well informed opinions</span>: The goal of the author can be to entertain or to spread (mis)information, and the material can be influenced by various factors. Being media literate allows us to form educated opinions on the topic instead of believing everything we read.</li>

				<li class="importance-list"><span class="accent">Helps check if the data is credible</span>: We can recognise whether the information presented is trustworthy and backed by good quality sources,
				or if the author is deliberately trying to mislead us into believing conspiracy theories not backed by any evidence.</li>

				<li class="importance-list"><span class="accent">Helps recognise the author’s point of view</span>: Being media literate can help us move beyond our personal biases and prejudices, and open our minds to new perspectives.</li>

				<li class="importance-list"><span class="accent">Helps us become a smart consumer</span>: Media literacy enables us to interact with media in an informed way, forming our own opinions, and resisting targeted advertising techniques.</li>

				<li class="importance-list"><span class="accent">Helps us create our own media</span>: Lastly, being media literate allows us make our own media content responsibly, making it easier to express our opinions.</li>

				<p class="last-para">
					Thus, it is important to be media literate to both create and consume media..

				Try to reason out why a particular post was created. Is it merely for entertaining the viewers, or is it trying to persuade them towards a certain belief or conspiracy? Does it include only one side of the story and ignore other important viewpoints? Or is it un-biased and well-rounded? Often, the facts might be cherry-picked to suit a specific agenda or narrative held by the publisher, and hence, it cannot be trusted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if the intent behind a post is harmless and the authors are neutral and unbiased, we should check the quality of their information before accepting it as the truth. Often, there is misuse or misquotation of statistics and the findings of research studies, usually to generate more clicks. Genuine publishers include a bibliography or list of sources used - do look into them on your own and evaluate the evidence provided. Is it published by a for-profit to suit their own vested interest, or by a peer-reviewed, neutral party?
			</p>
			<p class="last-para">
				Lastly, think about how you felt after going through the content? Was it trying to make you feel a certain emotion on purpose?  Some headlines exaggerate the findings, or try inducing fear or panic among the public, since such messages get the most views and reactions. Read through the entire post and its sources before overreacting.
